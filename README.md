### Database
We never stored any data in any other third party database we use our own database in our Vps so no one has access to the database. And we don't have access to users personal data but if any user wants their data removal read below for more.
### Guild Data
We store some guild data when the user requests to some command which requires storing guild data.
</br>
### User Data
We do not store any data apart from the Commands Database, and we do not ask access to users personal data.
We Follow all Discord's Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.
</br>
### Message content 
We store message content which messages are deleted and for each channel and it's stored untill another message gets deleted. So we never stored any of the message content in our database or in any other platforms outside.
</br>
### Data removal 
User's can remove their all guild data by **kicking** bot from their guild so every data stored related to guild is erased so the users has a easy way of removal of their data.
